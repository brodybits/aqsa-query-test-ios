## About

This project demonstrates the following:
- Ability to request native iOS functionality from within a web worker.
- Build a hybrid Javascript-native app without using a framework such as Cordova which requires attribution of use.

## Security warning

The Cordova project has been fixing security issues in its external domain whitelist plugin over time, and has also dealt with security issues in its internal bridging mechanism. It is very strongly advised NOT to release an app with a custom-built web view bridging or domain whitelisting mechanism without proper code review and testing.
